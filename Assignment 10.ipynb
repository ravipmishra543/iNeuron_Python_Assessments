If `dest` is a folder name the `src` with exact name will be copied to the dest folder, if its a file then the contents of `src` will be copied to `dest` where `dest` retains it name.\n",

The important catch here is `dest` must not exist prior to this and it will be created during the copy operation. Permissions and times of directories are copied with `shutil.copystat()` and individual files are copied using `shutil.copy2()` by default which can be modified using `copy_function` attribute."
